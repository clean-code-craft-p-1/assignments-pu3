# Fail the test

Tests are passing even if the code is buggy! **WAIT!** Do not fix the code!

Strengthen the test to fail a defective implementation. You may refactor the code, but do not fix the bugs.

Be skeptical about the green tick! It's a false positive. Make it into a red-colored cross with strong tests.

While you are strengthening the test:

- Does the test express what a consumer would want?
- Do you see assumptions becoming explicit?
- Any situations uncovered?
- Do you need higher skills to write the test?
- Do you enjoy it?
